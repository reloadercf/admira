## Characteristics of My Project

Previously, I asked the question: ***How to present dynamic information??*** ...
The answer was to use charts.

- The first step was understand the problem
- The second steps was start the boilerplate:
  - Initialize a vite project with react and ts
  - config the router
  - add tailwind and shadcn
- Finally I began coding.
